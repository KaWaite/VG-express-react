# Video Game Site

This site was getting me more comfortable with Express, React-Router, and first time using React Hooks.

## Next Steps

The idea moving forward would be to potentially use this site(or rebuild to solidify Express, React-router, hooks, etc) and add a database(SQL or API) to hold hundreds/thousands of games that are searchable. From there, setup signup, login/logout, and eventually add games to user.
